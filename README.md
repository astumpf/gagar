Installation
------------
First of all, install the GTK dependencies.
Under Arch Linux, run

    pacman -S python-gobject python-cairo pygtk

Other distros should have similar packages.
Someone told me it even works on Mac using MacPorts.
If you get it to work, please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/Gjum/gagar/issues/8), so I can add instructions for your system.

The client itself can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?name=gagar&:action=display) with

    pip install gagar

or, if you want to get the source code,

    git clone git@github.com:Gjum/gagar.git
    cd gagar/
    python3 setup.py install

Run the GUI with

    gagar -h

About
-----
This is a hobby project of me, on which I work in my free time.

Pull requests are more than welcome, but you should open an issue first, so we can talk about it.

I reverse-engineered the protocol implementation by looking at the (barely) obfuscated Javascript code on the agar.io website.
Although it would be much easier now to write a client, because [there is a wiki](http://agar.gcommer.com/) describing the whole protocol and most game mechanics.

If you have any game-related questions, feel free to ask in the [#agariomods IRC channel on the Rizon network](http://irc.lc/rizon/agariomods/CodeBlob@@@).
For questions about this client specifically, [open an issue](https://github.com/Gjum/gagar/issues/new) or write me an email: [code.gjum@gmail.com](mailto:code.gjum@gmail.com)

Disclaimer
----------
This project isn't affiliated with [agar.io](http://agar.io/) in any way. When playing with this client, you do not get advertisements, which may be nice for you, but does not pay for the servers needed to run the game.
